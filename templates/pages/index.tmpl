            <h1>CryProcessor</h1>
            <p>CryProcessor is a python-written tool for searching and extracting Cry toxins from illumina sequence data or from the protein fasta files. It includes several parts: an hmm-based scanning for potential Cry toxins, obtaining information about the domains, extracting Cry toxins with 3 domains only and comparing found toxins with Bt nomenclature.</p>

            <p>The mode for performing the toxins search directly from the illumina reads implies building an assembly graph (using SPAdes) and the subsequent mining toxins directly from the obtained assebmly graph.</p>
